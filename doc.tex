\maketitle

\section{Project Overview}
We are developing a minimal 802.16-2009 OFDM Transmitter PHY.  This PHY
supports only QPSK-1/2 modulation-convolution rate. Additionally, any
components not relevant to unlicensed bands are omitted.  All optional items
are omitted.

This PHY requires the cooperation of a MAC layer implementation which is
compliant with the 802.16-2009 standard in order for the compliance
expectations (\autoref{sec:comply}) to be met.

	\subsection{End Market Expectations}
	Currently IEEE 802.16, also known as ``WiMAX'', has seen little
	deployment in the United States and western Europe while being
	moderately deployed in Asian nations and Eastern European markets.
	To be useful in western areas, WiMAX has to effectively compete
	with both consumer owned Wifi hot-spots and the various cell phone
	networks. Given the impressively low cost of both cellular and Wifi
	(802.11) systems combined with the expectation that they work well
	in mobile devices, this physical layer (PHY) targets both
	simplicity (to reduce cost) and reduced power consumption.

	\subsection{Degree of standards compliance and scope limitations}
	\label{sec:comply}
	The 802.16 standard specifies multiple layers of a WiMAX device,
	including a ``Service-specific convergence
	sublayer''~\cite[section 5]{IEEE:802.16}, a MAC
	sublayer~\cite[section 6]{IEEE:802.16}, a Security
	sublayer~\cite[section 7]{IEEE:802.16}, and the Physical
	layer~\cite[section 8]{IEEE:802.16}. 
	
	The PHY, while being described within section 8 of the 802.16-2009
	document, is additionally subject to certain constraints and
	requirements stipulated within the other sections.  These sections
	where only utilized to the extent to which they apply to design of
	the PHY component.

	Applicable sections of \cite{IEEE:802.16}.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Section 8.3 - OFDM description
		\item Section 8.3.3.4.1 - Data Modulation: implementation
			is not compliant with this section, only QPSK
			modulation is supported.
		\item 8.3.3.4.3 - Rate ID encodings: not compliant with
			this section, only the QPSK-1/2 rate ID is supported.
		\item 8.3.5.1.1 - DL subchannelization: Rate ID
	\end{itemize}

\section{Electrical Characteristics}
All voltages of logic levels are defined by the FPGA on which the product's
code is placed.

\section{OFDM Parameters}

\subsection{Primitive Parameters}

\begin{description}
	\item[BW]: This is the nominal channel bandwidth.
	\item[$N_{used}$]: Number of used subcarriers.
	\item[n]: Sampling factor. This parameter, in conjunction with BW
		and $N_{used}$ determines the subcarrier spacing, and the
		useful symbol time.
	\item[G]: This is the ratio of CP time to ``useful'' time.
\end{description}


\todo[inline]{Insert a table of the values that are fixed by the standard and our
implimentation limitations}

\subsection{Derived Parameters}

\begin{description}
	\item[$N_{FFT}$]: Smallest power of two greater than $N_{used}$
	\item[Sampling Frequency]: $F_s = floor ( n \cdot BW / 8000 )
		\times 8000 $
	\item[Subcarrier spacing]: $\Delta f = F s / N_{FFT} $
	\item[Useful symbol time]: $T_b = 1 / \Delta f$
	\item[CP Time]: $T_g = G \cdot T_b$
	\item[OFDM Symbol Time]: $T_s = T_b + T_g$
	\item[Sampling time]: $T_b / N_{FFT}$

\section{External Interface to the PHY Transmitter}
\label{sec:frame}
The MAC interfaces with the PHY module by sending frames (with the
appropriate headers and padding included) as a stream of bits.  These bits
are clocked via the \textbf{mac\_clk\_in} line, and must only be sent when
the \textbf{mac\_sending\_frame} line is high.  The state of the
\textbf{mac\_sending\_frame} line must be low when not sending a frame, and
must be lowered and raised between frames that would otherwise be abutting.
The frequency of \textbf{mac\_clk\_in} must be less than or equal to half
of the \textbf{phy\_clock}.

The \textbf{phy\_ready} line is a signal to the mac that it is ready for a
new frame to be inputed, and should not be ignored.

The structure of individual frames detailed in section 8.3.5 of IEEE
802.16-2009.  Each frame contains a header, up to 4 DL sub-frames (each with
their own structure also defined in IEEE802.16-2009 section 8.3.5) and some
number of UL sub-frames.  Note that due to fixing certain implementation
parameters, some fields are constrained further than mentioned within the
standard.

\begin{description}
	\item[Frame Header - Rate\_ID] is fixed at '1' indicating QPSK
		modulation with a code rate of $1 over 2$.

\section{Internal Interfaces}
This section covers the interfaces for internal structures within the PHY
transmitter which are not exposed for use by the MAC or any other interfacing
hardware.

\autoref{tbl:internal-common-wire} shows some of the common signals for
the internal interfaces.

\begin{table*}
\begin{tabulary}{\textwidth}{c|C|L}
	\label{tbl:internal-common-wire}
	Name & Active Level & Meaning \\ \hline
	
	\texttt{*\_valid} & high & Indicate the source outputting the signal
	is also outputting data (clocked via the \texttt{phy\_clock}) which
	should be processed by the next item in the chain. \\

	\texttt{*\_bits} & high & A serial stream of bits clocked by
	\texttt{phy\_clock}. Only valid when the corresponding
	\texttt{*\_valid} line is also active. \\

	\texttt{*\_flag} & high & Set active for a single clock cycle
	before becoming inactive again.
\end{tabulary}
\caption{Common signals used internally}
\end{table*}

Each block of the transmitter connected via direct wiring (without a
buffer) is given the same clock. Each block reads its inputs on alternating
clock edges such that two adjacent units read and write on different edges.
This is done so that outputted data does not change while being read.

This is a Reed-Solomon and convolution coding combination
which is applied per frame. Within the standard, different
RS (Reed-Solomon) codes and CC (convolution code) rates are
used for varying modulation types. As we have fixed the
modulation and code rate to QPSK-1/2, one two of the RS
code and CC rate pairs are needed, as indicated in the
\autoref{tbl:fec-param}.

See \autoref{tbl:fec-io} for a listing of the inputs and outputs.

%% INTERLEAVER

	\subsection{Interleaving}
	\label{sec:interleaving}
	\begin{description}
		\item[Responsible person] John
		\item[Estimated gates] 2000
		\item[Estimated data bitstream delay] UNKNOWN -- FIXME.
	\end{description}
	
	All encoded data bits will be interleaved by this block interleaver. The
	block size is defined by the number of coded bits per allocated subchannels 
	per OFDM symbol ($N_{cbps}$). 
 
	\begin{center}
  	\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
	\hline
	\multicolumn{6}{|c|}{Block sizes of the Interleaver} \\ \hline
	\multicolumn{6}{|c|}{$N_{cbps}$} \\ \hline
  	& 16 subchannels & 8 & 4 & 2 & 1 \\ \hline
	QPSK & 384 & 192 & 96 & 48 & 24 \\ \hline
	\end{tabular}
  	\end{center}

	Interleaving is a two step type operation. The first step ensures adjacent 
	coded bits are mapped onto nonadjacent subcarriers and the second step 
	ensures bits are mapped alternately onto less and more significant bits of
	the constellation. The second step is done to avoid long runs of lowly
	reliable bits.
	 
	The permutations are dependent on the number of coded bits per subcarrier
	($N_{cpc}$), which is defined by the type of modulation and the index of the
	coded bit before permutation (k).

	For our implementation, as we are only using QPSK modulation,
	$N_{cpc} = 2$.
	
	k : index of coded bit before first permutation

	$m_{k}$ : index after first permutation

	$j_{k}$ : index after second permutation 

  First permutation equation :
  \begin{equation}
  m_k = (N_{cbps}/12)*k_{mod12}+floor(k/12)
  \end{equation}

	Second permutation equation :
	\begin{equation}
	s=ceil(N_{cpc}/2) \\
	\end{equation}
	\begin{eqnarray}
	j_k = s*floor(m_{k}/s)+(m_{k}+N_{cbps}- \nonumber \\
		floor(12*m_k/N_{cbps}))_{mod(s)}
	\end{eqnarray}

	After the interleaving the first bit out of the interleaver would map to the
	MSB for the constellation mapping. 
	
	\begin{table*}
		\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{X|X|X|}
		\label{tbl:interleave}
			Signal name & From/To &
			Description \\ \hline
			fec\_buffer\_out & From Buffer & A block of $N_{cbps}$ bits are read
			along this line \\ \hline
			fec\_buffer\_done & From Buffer & Indicates on high that a block of
		 	encoded bits are ready to be read \\ \hline
			interleave\_reset & From Control Logic & On high, causes reset\\ \hline
			interleave\_out\_enable & To Constellation Mapping & On high output
			line of bits is valid and ready to read \\ \hline
			interleaved\_bits & To Constellation Mapping & Interleaved bits are
			sent on this line \\ \hline
		\end{tabularx}
		\caption{Interleaver IO signals}
	\end{table*}
	
  \subsubsection{Testing and Verification}
  
  The Interleaver operation can be verified by inputting a known block of bits
  and observing the output. With the equations defined in the IEEE 802.16
  document, the appropriate Interleaver output can be calculated and compared
  directly. 
  
  *Add example test inputs and outputs.

		\item[Estimated data bitstream delay] UNKNOWN -- FIXME.
	\end{description}

	Input is (I,Q) pair, output is (I,Q) pair with pilot subcarriers
	inserted at some points (fixed).

	\subsection{Sub-carrier to IFFT Buffer}
	\label{sec:ifft-buffer}
	\begin{description}
		\item[Responsible person] John Huang
		\item[Estimated gates] 2000
		\item[Estimated data bitstream delay] UNKNOWN -- FIXME.
	\end{description}
	Insertion into this buffer is ordered but will have random
	jumps around different UL \& DL bursts.

	Block Size = blk\_siz = 200 (the total number of used
	subcarriers)
	
	Buffers blk\_size items each of which has width 2 bits.
	QPSK utilizes both I and Q, amplitude and phase, each with
	a granularity of 2. This means that each item (a pair of I
	\& Q) has 4 possible values and thus 2 bits are needed for
	each.

	\subsection{IFFT}
	\label{sec:ifft}
	\begin{description}
		\item[Responsible person] John Huang
		\item[Estimated gates] 10,000
		\item[Estimated data bitstream delay] UNKNOWN -- FIXME.
	\end{description}

	The IFFT takes in 256-bit complex samples and outputs to the Cyclic Prefix generator. 
	
	IFFT Size: 256 items (each being a complex number)
	\begin{description}
		\item{Inputs:}
		\begin{description}
			\item[ifft\_buf\_has\_block] The count of the last
				block present in the Sub to IFFT buffer
				(\autoref{sec:ifft-buffer})
			
			\item[ifft\_buf\_data{[200][2][??ndepth]}] access
				to the data at the present 'tail' location
				in the buffer
		\end{description}
		
		\item{Outputs:}
		\begin{description}
			\item[ifft\_data\_ready] high when the IFFT has
				processed data.

	\subsection{Cyclic Prefix}
	\label{sec:cyclic_prefix}
	\begin{description}
		\item[Responsible person] John Huang
		\item[Estimated gates] 2000
		\item[Estimated data bitstream delay] About 1050 clocks.
	\end{description}
	
	The Cyclic Prefix is used to act as protection from Intersymbol Interference 
	by duplicating a certain number of symbols defined by the $CP_rate$.
	
	The Cyclic Prefix appends to the front of the symbol a copy of the last
 	$256/CP_{rate}$ ($N_{IFFT}/CP_{rate}$) bits. OFDM PHY should allow for four
	(4) rates as defined by 2 bits in the PHY Mode ID field. 
	
	It reads 256 2 bit items from the IFFT into 2 256 blocks of memory.
	On output, the appropriate number of bits are read from the end of 
	memory by offset.
	
	At a rate of $1/4$, 64 bits would need to be read from the end and 
	at a rate of $1/32$, 8 bits would need to be read.
	
	The sample size would then increase from 256 bits to anywhere between
	264 to 320 bits.
	
	For our implementation, we will set the CP rate at $1/16$ which leads to
	a sample size of 272 bits.
	
	This process would take about about 512 clocks to read in the data to fill
	memory and about 528 clocks to write out. 

	The total time would include clocks to set and check valid lines and would
	total to about 1050 clocks.

  This design should be able to run on both the Spartan-3 FPGA and Virtex 4 LX60
  FPGA as they both supply a 500 MHz clock.
  
  \subsection{Power Calculation}
  
  Calculate power based on required clock frequency for the device as well as the
  FPGA specifications for voltage inputs.
  
  Absolute Maximum rating for $V_{in}$ : 4.4 V
  
  Clock frequency required for a 3.5 MHz channel bandwidth : 4.083 MHz
  
  Input capacitance over recommended operating conditions : 10 pF
	%Input capacitance per input pin?
  \begin{center}
  \begin{equation}
  P = C * V^2 * f = 10 pF * (4.4 V)^2 * 4.083 MHz = 0.18 mW
  \end{equation}
  \end{center}
