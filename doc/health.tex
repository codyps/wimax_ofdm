\section{Health, Safety, and Environmental Issues}

\subsection{Product Dangers}

Potential for heat, radiation, and distraction while operating equipment (depending on what type of end-user device this implementation is integrated into. As this is only a component of an arbitrary end user device, dangers caused or directly inferred from its use are limited.

\subsection{Health Hazards}

As a wireless transmitter, certain power outputs at particular frequencies could be dangerous for people to be in close proximity to. These power levels and transmission frequencies are not handled within this project, rather, they fall to the real of the analog transmitter portion.

\subsection{Environmental Hazards}

As a wireless device, any implementation utilizing this code will need to obtain FCC approval to ensure it properly uses the frequency ``space'' allocated to it. Notably, the WiMAX specification provides for both licensed and unlicensed frequency range use, meaning additional approval could be required from the owner of the particular band the device operates in.
