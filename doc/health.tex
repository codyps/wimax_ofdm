\section{Health, Safety, and Environmental Issues}

\subsection{Product Dangers}

Potential for heat, radiation, and distraction while operating equiptment (depending on what type of end-user device this implimentation is integrated into. As this is only a component of an arbitrary end user device, dangers caused or directly infered from its use are limited.

\subsection{Health Hazards}

As a wireless transmitter, certain power outputs at particular frequencies could be dangerous for people to be in close proximity to. These powerlevels and transmision frequencies are not handled within this project, rather, they fall to the real of the analog transmitter portion.

\subsection{Environmental Hazards}

As a wireless device, any implimentation utilizing this code will need to obtain FCC approval to ensure it properly uses the frequency ``space'' allocated to it. Notably, the WiMAX specification provides for both licenced and unlicenced frequency range use, meaning additional approval could be required from the owner of the particular band the device operates in.
