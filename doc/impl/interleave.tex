All encoded data bits will be interleaved by this block interleaver. The
block size is defined by the number of coded bits per allocated subchannels 
per OFDM symbol ($N_{cbps}$). $N_{cbps}$ is determined by a
combination of the number of subchannels and the modulation used, see
\autoref{tbl:Ncbps} for a listing of possible values.

Interleaving is a two step type operation. The first step ensures adjacent 
coded bits are mapped onto nonadjacent subcarriers and the second step 
ensures bits are mapped alternately onto less and more significant bits of
the constellation. The second step is done to avoid long runs of lowly
reliable bits.
 
The permutations are dependent on the number of coded bits per subcarrier
($N_{cpc}$), which is defined by the type of modulation and the index of the
coded bit before permutation (k).

For our implementation, as we are only using QPSK modulation,
$N_{cpc} = 2$.

k : index of coded bit before first permutation

$m_{k}$ : index after first permutation

$j_{k}$ : index after second permutation 

First permutation equation :
\begin{equation}
m_k = (N_{cbps}/12)*k_{mod12}+floor(k/12)
\end{equation}

Second permutation equation :
\begin{equation}
s=ceil(N_{cpc}/2) \\
\end{equation}
\begin{eqnarray}
j_k = s*floor(m_{k}/s)+(m_{k}+N_{cbps}- \nonumber \\
	floor(12*m_k/N_{cbps}))_{mod(s)}
\end{eqnarray}

After the interleaving the first bit out of the interleaver would map to the
MSB for the constellation mapping. 

	\subsubsection{Testing and Verification}
	The Interleaver operation can be verified by inputting a known block
	of bits and observing the output. The standard document provides a few of these for our use. Additional input/output vectors where generated for verification purposes by directly converting the permutation equations into a simple proceedural program (\autoref{lst:interleave-py})

IEEE 802.16 document, the appropriate Interleaver output can be
	calculated and compared directly. 

	\subsubsection{Implimentation Notes}

Due to the complexity of the permutation, code was written which generates the verilog implimentation for all posible variations in $N_{cpc}. In a further iteration of the transmitter, a multiplexer would be used to switch to the appropriate interleaver for each type of modulation. A partial implimentation of this multiplexing was written.
