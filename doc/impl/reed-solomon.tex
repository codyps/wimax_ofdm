This is a Reed-Solomon and convolution coding combination
which is applied per frame. Within the standard, different
RS (Reed-Solomon) codes and CC (convolution code) rates are
used for varying modulation types. As we have fixed the
modulation and code rate to QPSK-1/2, one two of the RS
code and CC rate pairs are needed, as indicated in the
\autoref{tbl:fec-param}.

See \autoref{tbl:fec-io} for a listing of the inputs and outputs.

\subsubsection{Notes on delay}

Both the Reed-Solomon and convolution encoding append additional bits to the bitstream. The convolution encoder emits at most 2 bits for every one bit of input (the 1/2 rate, used with BPSK). The Reed-Solomon encoder appends the residue of its operation to the tail of the bitstream. As it operates of $GF(8)$, 8 bits will be appended. Additionally, between the RS and CC additional bits are appended to such that the bitstream is kept at a multiple of $N_{cbps}$ bytes.
